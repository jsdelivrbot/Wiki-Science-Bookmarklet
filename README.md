# leoBookmarklet
Developing my first bookmarklet. Not totally sure what I want it to do yet, but would like it to evaluate the popularity or legitimacy (if possible) of a scientific wikipedia article. Will evaluate each reference's popularity (with something like PageRank?) or if it's a journal, its impact factor. Work in progress.
